## Introduction

Superheroes Unite is my fourth portfolio project and is a Superhero blog with post relating to the Marvel and DC Universe. It's aimed at anyone who has an exisitng, or new interest in the world of superheroes, and who may even be keen to submit their own comments on existing posts.

The full website is available to view [here](https://project4-blog-ap-0464f823fc69.herokuapp.com/)

## UX Design

Project Goals

The primary goals for this project was to create a blog with full CRUD functionality so that users can register an account, view posts, add comments and also edit and delete them if needed.

Strategy

An agile methodology was used when planning this project - a kanban board ([view it here](https://github.com/users/alanpaterson82/projects/7/views/1)) was used in Github with various issues having their own acceptance criteria and tasks to be completed.

## Introduction

Superheroes Unite is my fourth portfolio project and is a Superhero blog with post relating to the Marvel and DC Universe. It's aimed at anyone who has an exisitng, or new interest in the world of superheroes, and who may even be keen to submit their own comments on existing posts.

## UX Design

Project Goals

The primary goals for this project was to create a blog with full CRUD functionality so that users can register an account, view posts, add comments and also edit and delete them if needed.

Strategy

An agile methodology was used when planning this project - a kanban board ([view it here](https://github.com/users/alanpaterson82/projects/7/views/1)) was used in Github with various issues having their own acceptance criteria and tasks to be completed.

## User Stories

As a user admin I can review and manage all content so that all inappropriate or irrelevant details can be removed

* AC1 - When logged in, they can read, review, edit and delete comments and posts

<br>

As a new user I can register my details so that I can access my account and post personalised content

* AC1 - Username/ email field to be added
* AC2 - Unique password field to be added
* AC3 - When logged in they can post under their unique details

<br>

As a site user I can comment on posts so that I can interact with others through personalised views and responses

* AC1 - When logged in, a user can add a comment
* AC2 - When logged in, any other users can respond
* AC3 - A conversation can be started

<br>

As a guest user I can view all posts so that I can gain information

* AC1 - A guest user can click on, and read, all comments and posts but will be unable to leave their own comment

<br>

As a site user I can edit and delete my comments so that I am in control of my personal content

* AC1 - When logged in, they can delete thier existing comments
